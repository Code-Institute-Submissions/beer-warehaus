Beer WareHaus is an online shop for a hypothetical beer import and distribution company in Norway. The purpose of the site is to provide a simple intuitive ways for managers of bars and restaurants to browse and purchase products they wish to serve.
Additionally the site provides a number of tools allowing the shop owner to easily manage the products in the shop.

The site has been deployed to Heroku and can be viewed [here](https://beer-warehaus.herokuapp.com/).

## UX

### Project Goal

This project is my fourth and final Milestone Project in the Code Institute's Fullstack Development program. The purpose of this project was to create an e-commerce site using the Django framework, static file hosting with AWS, and a functional payment system with Stripe. This e-commerce site is fully functional and could be used by a real beer distribution company with minimal setup.

### Wireframes

Following these user stories, wireframes were drawn to provide a starting point and guidance throughout the development process.

![Beer WareHaus Wireframes](readme-files/wireframe.png)

-   The mobile wireframes can be found [here](readme-files/beer-warehaus-mobile.pdf)

### Data Structure

Before starting the development of the application, its models and their relationships were delineated:

![Beer WareHaus Models](readme-files/beer-warehaus-models.png)

### Design

The application was built using bootstrap and its responsive grid system.
Fonts and colors were carefully chosen to give the application a distinctive brand and feel.

#### Typography

Two fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used throughout the site:

1. **Roboto Slab** was used for the logo and the navigation of the site.

![Roboto Slab Font](readme-files/roboto-slab.png)

1. **Lato** was used for all the titles and contents of the site.

![Lato Font](readme-files/lato.png)

#### Colors

A simple color scheme was used to accentuate readability and usability.

-   ![#1b1b1b](https://placehold.it/15/1b1b1b/000000?text=+) `#1b1b1b - dark grey, primary color`

This color is used in the header's background and for fonts throughout the site. It was chosen for its simplicity and for providing contrast with other colors.

-   ![#f8f8fb](https://placehold.it/15/f8f8fb/000000?text=+) `#f8f8fb - off white, background-color`

This off white was chosen for the background color for the site as it provides good contrast with the other chosen colors, while being easier on the eyes than white.

-   ![#ffc717](https://placehold.it/15/ffc717/000000?text=+) `#ffc717 - gold, highlight color #1`

This yellow was used to highlight specific elements of the site to provide users with a visual aid on actions that can be performed, for example on buttons. It is also echoed in the site's logo, providing brand consistency.

-   ![#077f94](https://placehold.it/15/077f94/000000?text=+) `#077f94 - blue, highlight color #2`

This blue is used as a secondary highlight, meant to contrast with and compliment the gold buttons. They are used for links, and to help highlight product cards in listings.

-   ![#00d9ff](https://placehold.it/15/00d9ff/000000?text=+) `#00d9ff - blue, highlight color #2 alternative`

This lighter shade of blue was used as an alternative to the previously described blue and was used to highlight new products in listings.

## Testing

Testing was done manually throughout the development process. The full rundown of the testing can be found [here](TESTING.md).

Additionally, all code was validated in the following ways:

**HTML** - All pages were successfully run through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure compliance with the standards set by the W3C.

**CSS** - CSS validation with the [W3C Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) returned some expected and necessary flags from vendor extensions. Other than that, the code complies to the W3C standards.

**Python** - All Python code was checked with the [PEP8 online validator](http://pep8online.com/) and is PEP8 compliant, aside from line length flags, which were left for code readability.

## Deployment

Before deploying the application, ensure the following are installed:

-   Python 3
-   PIP
-   Git
-   Heroku CLI

The application relies on the following services, and accounts will have to be created for them:

-   [Untappd API](https://untappd.com/api/docs)
-   [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
-   [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
-   An email account, [GMail](https://mail.google.com/) is ideal as it is reliable and easy to set up.

### Local Deployment

These are the steps to deploy Beer WareHaus locally.

1.  From the application's [repository](https://github.com/jumboduck/beer-warehaus), click the "code" button and download the zip of the repository.

    Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the following line in your terminal:

        git clone https://github.com/jumboduck/beer-warehaus.git

2.  Access the folder in your terminal window and install the application's required modules using the following command:

        python -m pip -r requirements.txt

3.  Create a file containing your environmental variables called `env.py` at the root level of the application. It will need to contain the following lines and variables:

    ```
    import os

    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_DJANGO_SECRET_KEY"

    os.environ["UNTAPPD_CLIENT_ID"] = "YOUR_UNTAPPD_CLIEND_ID"
    os.environ["UNTAPPD_SECRET"] = "YOUR_UNTAPPD_SECRET"

    os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"
    os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "YOUR_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET"

    os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"

    os.environ['EMAIL_HOST_USER'] = 'YOUR_EMAIL_USER'
    os.environ['EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD'] = 'YOUR_EMAIL_PASSWORD'
    os.environ['EMAIL_HOST'] = 'smtp.google.com' # for gmail
    os.environ['DEFAULT_ORDER_EMAIL'] = 'DEFAULT_EMAIL'
    ```

    Please note that you will need to update the `SECRET_KEY` with your own secret key, as well as the Untappd and strip keys and secret variables with those provided by those applications.

    If you plan on pushing this application to a public repository, ensure that `env.py` is added to your `.gitignore` file to protect your secrets.

4.  The application can now be run locally. In your terminal, type the command `python3 manage.py runserver`. The application will be available in your browser at the address `http://localhost:8000`.
