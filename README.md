# Beer WareHaus

Beer WareHaus is an online shop for a hypothetical beer import and distribution company in Norway. The purpose of the site is to provide a simple intuitive ways for managers of bars and restaurants to browse and purchase products they wish to serve.
Additionally the site provides a number of tools allowing the shop owner to easily manage the products in the shop.

## UX

### Project Goal

This project is my fourth and final Milestone Project in the Code Institute's Fullstack Development program. The purpose of this project was to create an e-commerce site using the Django framework, static file hosting with AWS, and a functional payment system with Stripe. This e-commerce site is fully functional and could be used by a real beer distribution company with minimal setup.
