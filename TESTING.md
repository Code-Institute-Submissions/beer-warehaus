# Testing

## Homepage

### Carousel

The carousel functions as intended, displaying an image, a title, a description and a link to a specified page.
Images of different sizes can be uploaded without breaking the layout of the elements of the page.

### New Products

The "New Products" section of the homepage shows all products marked as "new" by the site's administrator. The information displayed is correct. Products no longer display here if the flag is removed.

## Product Listing

The pages listing products display the correct information, for each product and the number of products..
The "back to top" button works as expected.

### Search

The search functionality works as intended. It returns products whose name, producer, style, and description contain the searched keyword.
The search unaccents characters (ie: a search for "biere" will return results containing "bi√®re") and accounts for capitalization.
